# Bookei
An AI-powered book generator
A little project I decided to make to start learning python

## How to use?
- Get a Google Gemini API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Clone the repo
- Run `final.py` or `gui.py` (for a GUI)

## Notices:
- Can successfully generate books up to ~80,000 total words with somewhat good narrative flow and with staying on topic all with one API key (free tier)
